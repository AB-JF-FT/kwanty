# Initialize OpenQL
ql.initialize()

# Set options
ql.set_option('output_dir', 'output')  # 'output' is a string specifying the directory for output files
ql.set_option('log_level', 'LOG_INFO')  # 'LOG_INFO' is a string specifying the log level

# Define the platform
platform = ql.Platform('my_platform', 'none')  # 'platform' is an instance of ql.Platform, created with a name and configuration

# Define the number of qubits
nqubits = 3  # 'nqubits' is an integer specifying the number of qubits

# Create a quantum program
program = ql.Program('quantum_teleportation', platform, nqubits)  
# 'program' is an instance of ql.Program, created with a name, a platform, and the number of qubits

# Create a quantum kernel
kernel = ql.Kernel('teleportation_kernel', platform, nqubits)
# 'kernel' is an instance of ql.Kernel, created with a name, a platform, and the number of qubits

# Initialize qubits to |0> state
for i in range(nqubits):
    kernel.prepz(i)  # 'i' is an integer index of the qubit to initialize

# Step 1: Create an entangled pair between qubit 1 and qubit 2
kernel.hadamard(1)  # Apply a Hadamard gate to qubit 1
kernel.cz(1, 2)  # Apply a controlled-Z gate between qubit 1 (control) and qubit 2 (target)

# Step 2: Apply operations to teleport the state of qubit 0 to qubit 2
# Assume qubit 0 is already in the state we want to teleport
kernel.cnot(0, 1)  # Apply a CNOT gate with qubit 0 as control and qubit 1 as target
kernel.hadamard(0)  # Apply a Hadamard gate to qubit 0

# Measure qubits 0 and 1
kernel.measure(0)  # Measure qubit 0
kernel.measure(1)  # Measure qubit 1

# Apply classical corrections based on measurement outcomes
# Note: These corrections are done conditionally based on classical measurement results,
# but for simplicity, we assume both measurements yield 0 (no corrections needed)
# In a real implementation, classical feedback would be required here.

# Step 3: Apply correction operations to qubit 2
# If measurement result of qubit 1 was 1, apply X gate to qubit 2
kernel.cnot(1, 2)  # Apply a CNOT gate with qubit 1 as control and qubit 2 as target

# If measurement result of qubit 0 was 1, apply Z gate to qubit 2
kernel.cz(0, 2)  # Apply a controlled-Z gate between qubit 0 (control) and qubit 2 (target)

# Add the kernel to the program
program.add_kernel(kernel)  # Add the kernel to the program

# Compile the program
program.compile()  # Compile the program to generate the necessary instructions for the quantum computer

print("Compiled quantum teleportation program.")  # Print a message indicating the compilation is complete
